# StateChart

This library is a pure-Elixir implementation of statecharts.
See Hariman's (sp?) paper: <insert link here>



## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `state_chart` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:state_chart, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
